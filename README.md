## Problem scenario:

## Suppose we have three types of characters in a GameApp:

1. Knight: Attacks with a sword; uses 3 strategies to defend (shield, dodge, magic barrier)
2. Wizard: Casts spells; uses magic barrier to defend
3. Archer: Shoots arrows; uses dodge to to defend

## Implement two types of Strategy:
## A.  DefenseStrategy
     1. Shield
     2. Dodge
     3. CreateMagic

## B.  AttackStrategy
     1.  CastSpell
     2.  ShootArrow
     3.  SwingSword
